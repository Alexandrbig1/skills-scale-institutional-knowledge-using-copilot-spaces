# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

OctoAcme runs iterative, outcome-focused projects that move work through clear gates from initiation to close. Projects start with a concise one-pager to validate the problem, stakeholders, and success metrics, then move into planning where the backlog is prioritized, estimates are assigned, and a release/milestone map is created. The lifecycle emphasizes small, shippable increments, data-informed decisions, and a Definition of Done that items must meet before entering the execution pipeline.

Operational workflows center on a project board flow (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and a disciplined pull request process that encourages small, focused changes, linked issues, acceptance criteria, and CI checks before review. Planning includes kickoff, backlog grooming, and dependency capture; releases follow a checklisted pipeline with pre-release verification, rollback planning, and post-deploy smoke tests. Risk and dependency tracking is maintained in a Risk Register and reviewed regularly so mitigations are visible and can be escalated when needed.

Roles and communication are clearly defined: Product Managers prioritize outcomes and success metrics, Project Managers coordinate schedules and risks, Developers deliver code and tests, QA validates acceptance criteria, and stakeholders receive regular updates. The cadence includes daily standups for blockers and progress, a weekly delivery sync, sprint demos/reviews, and monthly or milestone stakeholder reports; escalation paths and templates for status and incidents keep communications consistent and auditable.

Quality assurance and continuous improvement are embedded into the process: unit, integration, and end-to-end smoke tests are required, security scanning runs in CI, and manual QA is used when appropriate. Retrospectives after sprints, releases, or incidents produce prioritized action items that feed back into the backlog and are tracked to completion, while release notes, rollback plans, and incident playbooks reduce operational risk during deployments.
